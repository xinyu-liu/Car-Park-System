This Readme explain how to install, compile and run the code of the Car Park Control System.

1. How To Install
     - Unzip this file and you will get a file folder

2. How To Compile
     - Open Command Line Application (Start -- Run As -- cmd.exe)
     - Trace into the "src" file path. 
         (This can be reduced by setting environment variable.) 
     - Type in [javac -d ../out carparksystem/controls/*.java carparksystem/entities/*.java carparksystem/views/*.java]. 
         (This can be done by copying the command in the Square brackets[].)  

3. How To Run
   - Trace into the "out" file path. 
       (This can be reduced by setting environment variable.) 
   - Type in [java carparksystem.views.OutFrame]
       (This can be done by copying the command in the Square brackets[].)  

   Now the game is open as a frame is pop up.
